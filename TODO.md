To-Do
=========================

Features/changes to implement next.


1. `'.` normal-mode command to jump to last change
2. Change list and accompanying navigation
3. `Ctrl-T` normal-mode command to go back to previous spot after jumping to tag (going to definition, actually). This means the default key binding for the "transpose" command would need to be remapped, though.
