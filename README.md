Sublime Text User Package
=========================

This is my user-specific configuration for Sublime Text. Most of the configuration is around additions to Vintage to make it more Vim-like.


Features
--------

1. `:s` invokes Replace panel
2. `Y` yanks to end of line, rather than the whole line. This annoyed me in Vim as well.
3. `vintage_ctrl_keys: true` so Ctrl-R is Redo.
4. `:bd` closes current buffer
5. `:wq` saves current file and closes buffer
6. `:e` edits a file
7. `ZZ` saves and closes current file as a normal-mode command
